# Intro to Django
Django is a Python-based web framework.

Best features of Django:
- You can deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.
- There is a Django’s template language.
- Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types.
- Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. 
This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.
- One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes
Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the Django Software Foundation.
And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.
