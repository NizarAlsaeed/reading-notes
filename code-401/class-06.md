# How to use Random Module

`import random`

- `random.randint(lowest,highest)`:  a random integer
- `random.choice([a,b,c])`: Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
- `random.shuffle(list)`: The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
- `random.randrange(start, stop[, step])`: Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

### Risk Identification
1. Business Risks:  The risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

2. Testing Risks.

3. Premature Release Risk: unsatisfactory or untested software.

4. Software Risks.


### Perspective of Risk Assessment
Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.
### How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

1.    Searching the risk

2.    Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3.    Measures for the risk identified

# Big O Notation
four must know RulesWhen estimating Big O:
1. Different steps get added
2. Drop Constants
3. Different inputs => different variabels
4. Drop non-dominant terms
