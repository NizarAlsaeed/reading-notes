## Linux Basics


### Terminal

You are used to deal with the computer through the graphical user interface (GUI), but there is another way to use the computer through the terminal.
Terminals are text screen in which you write commands to the opertaing system and the system responds directly to the commands, i'll write the basics 
of using ubuntu terminal.

* commands:

pwd which stands for Print Working Directory, it just give you your current directory path
```
pwd 
```

ls. It's short for list. /  -> [ ] ) mean that those items are optional/ -l means long listing
```
ls [options] [location]
```
```
Ls -l /home/nizar
```
Ls: command, -l: option , /home/nizar:  argument

cd which stands for change directory. 
```
cd [location]
```
note: If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.






####	Absolute and Relative Paths

* ~ (tilde)  home directory
* . (dot)  current directory
* .. (dotdot)  parent directory
* / root directory.
 


#### remember that:
- Linux is an Extensionless System
- Linux is Case Sensitive, be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with command line options.
- Hidden Files and Directories names begins with a .
- use the command line option -a so that it does show hidden files and directories.
- shourtcuts are always helpful( up and down keys + Tab Completion )
